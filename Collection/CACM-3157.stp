proving termination multiset orderings common tool proving termination programs founded set set ordered admit infinite descending sequences basic approach find termination function maps values program variables founded set termination function repeatedly reduced computation termination functions required difficult find complexity proportion program consideration multisets bags founded set sets admit multiple occurrences elements ordering induces ordering finite multisets multiset ordering shown founded multiset ordering enables simple intuitive termination functions difficult termination proofs multiset ordering prove termination production systems programs defined terms sets rewriting rules cacm august 1979 dershowitz manna
